<p id="menu">Here at the Book Nook, we celebrate both established and budding authors alike,
    with presentations and signings from known authors and special activities to get younger
    audiences involved, as well.</p>

<p id="menu"><span>For Adults</span> <br/> <br/>
    Besides for book signings by celebrated authors, throughout the week there are sales on most of the store, and a pop
    up coffee shop to enjoy a break with a book. There are also be a featured books section, and additional surprises
    as the week progresses.<br/>

<span>For Kids</span> <br/> <br/>
    Several times throughout the week, children's authors will come for a bedtime story reading. There will also be
    booths with different reading and writing themed activities, including writing your own book, and voting in a voting
    booth for your favorite book.

<h2>How Book Nook Celebrates</h2>

<p><span>What is World Book Day?</span> <br/> <br/>
    Every year on April 23 is World Book Day, a day chosen for its significance in the literary world.
    Several renowned authors, William Shakespeare, Miguel de Cervantes and Inca Garcilaso de la Vega all died on this
    day.
    Therefore, we remember the contributions of these authors--and all others to this day--by celebrating all literary
    works.

<p><span>How Do We Celebrate?</span> <br/> <br/>
    Here at the Book Nook, we celebrate both established and budding authors alike,
    with presentations and signings from known authors and special activities to get younger
    audiences involved, as well.</p>

<p><span>For Adults</span> <br/> <br/>
    Besides for book signings by celebrated authors, throughout the week there are sales on most of the store, and a pop
    up coffee shop to enjoy a break with a book. There are also be a featured books section, and additional surprises
    as the week progresses.</p>

<p><span>For Kids</span> <br/> <br/>
    Several times throughout the week, children's authors will come for a bedtime story reading. There will also be
    booths with different reading and writing themed activities, including writing your own book, and voting in a voting
    booth for your favorite book.

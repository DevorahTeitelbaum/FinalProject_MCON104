<h2 id="menuTitle">Who we are and what do we do?</h2>

<p id="menu">Here at the Book Nook, we take pride in not just selling books, but fostering a connection to reading.
    We give our readers an experience, not just the ability to purchase books. From caring literary experts to help
    you with the tough choice of which book to choose, to events that connect you, your friends, and family to reading,
    we truly open the door to experiencing the joy that a good book can give.</p>

<p id="menu"><span>Our Curated Collection</span> <br/> <br/>
    Besides for all of the classics and tranding reads, we have a collection of antique books for sale. These are rare
    finds, old printings, and signed copies of famous books. Ask in store to be shown the collection.<br/>

    <span>Events</span> <br/> <br/>
    Several times throughout the week, we have events for both adults and kids. In-person book signings, meet-and-greets
    with your favorite authors, and special Mommy-and-me storytime are just part of the fun. We also change our schedule
    throughout the year to keep things exciting. Keep an eye out for seasonal events, like our Spring outdoor reading day,
    or our Winter reading challenge checklist. This is in addition to our one of a kind annual event starting on World Book
    Day and continuing for the week.
